<h3 id="a1">COMPUTER</h3>
<a href="#c1">Go to top</a>
<p>
A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operation.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
<h4 id="a2">CPU</h4>
<p>
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program 
by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.
 The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers 
to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer
 from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.</p>
<h4 id="a3">ALU</h4>
<p>
An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations.
 It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. 
In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU).</p>
<h3 id="a4">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h3>
<p>
A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.
Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. 
Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
<h4 id="a5">C</h4>
<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming,
 lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations</p>
<h4 id="a6">C++</h4>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language.
 It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
<h3 id="a7">DBMS</h3>
<p>
A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database.
The DBMS essentially serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs, 
ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.</p>
<h4 id="a8">RDBMS</h4>
<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as 
invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. In 2017, many of the databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.<p>
